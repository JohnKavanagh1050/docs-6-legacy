# What is Directus Hosted?

## Directus Hosted is a highly scalable DBaaS (Database as a Service) platform for developers looking to easily give their clients an intuitive cloud-based interface for managing app/website content.

With a Directus Hosted account you can manage all your instances in one place, creating new Directus instances in seconds. Simply choose a name and size for your instance and within seconds you'll have a new SQL database ready to completely customize with your project's specific data architecture. Use the dynamic RESTful API to pull data into your app or website â€“ or just use Directus as a standalone tool, similar to FileMaker. Either way, an unlimited number of users can upload files and manage database content, all based on granular group permissions.
