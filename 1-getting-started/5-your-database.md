# Your Database

### Choosing an Existing Schema
If you're looking to get up and running as quickly or possible, you may want to choose from our small but growing [library of schema boilerplates](#). Directus will also work with most SQL schemas you find elsewhere – though the formatting of some table/field names may be less intuitive to users.

### Creating & Customizing Schemas
Whether you're adapting a preexisting database or starting from scratch – the following guidelines will help you get the most out of Directus.

### Table & Field Naming
Directus auto-formats all table and field names for presentation to the users, so it's important to consider your naming system.

* Underscores become spaces
* Each word is capitalized
  * Edge-cases are handled by an editable array of overrides
* `_id` is removed from the end of titles

### Primary Key

### Status Field

### Order Field

### Datatypes
