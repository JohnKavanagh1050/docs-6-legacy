# Create & Edit
### Core and Custom UIs
The create and edit pages are the same – the only difference is that one already has values entered into it. This page displays all the fields the current user has permission to view. You can change the field order, interface type, and notes within _Settings > Tables & Inputs_. Also, it's easy to extend or create interfaces for specific needs – there's no limit to the styling or complexity of custom UIs.
