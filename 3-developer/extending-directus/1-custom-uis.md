# Custom User-Inputs (UIs)
Similar to extensions, if you need an input more specific to your application than provided by core Directus, you can duplicate, tweak, or create your own. Need a custom room-mapping interface or a proprietary client input? Just create a quick custom UI and it will immediately be available for use.
