# Custom Extensions
By design, Directus keeps things simple. Only key features utilized by more than 80% of users make it into the core software. Anything not covered under the base suite is possible within extensions. Extensions take advantage of the systemâ€™s authentication, ACL, and data connections but force absolutely no restrictions. These sandboxed areas can be used to create custom interfaces, data-visualizations, interaction points, dashboards, point-of-sales, or anything else required by your project.
