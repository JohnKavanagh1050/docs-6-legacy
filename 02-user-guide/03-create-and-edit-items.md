# Create & Edit
### Core and Custom UIs
These pages display all the fields the current user has permission to view. Admins can change the field order, interface type, and field notes within _Settings > Tables & Inputs_. If your project would benefit from proprietary or otherwise custom data interfaces, it's easy to extend our Core interfaces or create new ones – there are no limits to what you can create!

----------

### Saving
Once you've added or edited data on the page, you'll probably want to save those changes. As with other Directus pages, the (✓) button at the top of the screen will both save and return you to the listing. On this page however, to the right of the primary button there's an additional triangle dropdown providing three additional options:

* **Save** – (Primary action button) Saves changes and returns you to the item listing page
* **Save and Stay** – Saves changes and keeps you on the edit page
* **Save as Copy** – Saves the current item (with changes) as a _new_ item, the original item you opened is unchanged.
* **Save and Add** – Saves changes and takes you to a blank new item page for that table. This option can be useful when repetatively adding items.

----------

### Item Comments
In addition to a full messaging system, you can also leave comments on individual items from their detail page. For example, you could let the other users know that the item still needs to be reviewed before going live – or reference specific users with the "@" character. When referenced in comments, users will receive a Directus notification and, if set within their preferences, an accompanying email.

----------

### Revision History
Every change made by users within Directus is tracked to give comprehensive accountability. The user, their IP address and user-agent, the date/time of the change, any effected data (delta), and a _complete_ item backup are all saved for each and every edit. You can see a history of these changes at the bottom of this item detail page – commingled chronologically with any item comments.
