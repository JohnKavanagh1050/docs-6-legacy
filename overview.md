# Directus Overview
_Free and Open-Source MySQL Database GUI_

Directus is a customer-facing MySQL database GUI for managing your project’s content – not your development process. Create database architectures based on specific project needs, design websites and applications without any limitations, and follow any development workflow you prefer.

More simply, Directus is the best way to intuitively manage the content within a SQL database. As a developer, you're probably already managing content directly through Sequel-Pro, phpMyAdmin, or the command line. These are excellent tools because you get complete control with no setup other than entering the database credentials... but you would never give that access to clients, designers, or inexperienced engineers. Handling relational ids, media/file references, and data validation just isn't intuitive at that level – let alone the risk of accidentally deleting/truncating a table.

Now imagine you could allow anyone to manage that same database content through a simple, intuitive, and feature-rich interface – tailoring table/field access with granular user permissions. Innumerable Content Management Systems are probably coming to mind, but typically those bake-in entire front-end templating solutions, require complicated proprietary database schemas, and generally make a lot of assumptions about what you're doing and how to do it. Maybe the database isn't even _for_ a website – maybe it's for a native app, an inventory system, or internal project management.
