# Directus Overview
_Free and Open-Source MySQL Database GUI_

Directus is a customer-facing MySQL database GUI for managing your project’s content – not your development process. Create database architectures based on specific project needs, design websites and applications without any limitations, and follow any development workflow you prefer.

More simply, Directus is the best way to easily manage the content within a custom-schema SQL database. As a developer, you're probably already managing database content directly through Sequel-Pro, phpMyAdmin, or the command-line – but while those are excellent developer tools, you could never give that access to a client, designer, or other non-technical staff. Handling relational ids, media/file references, and data validation just isn't intuitive at that level – let alone the risk of accidentally deleting/truncating a table.
